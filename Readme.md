# One bit CPU

An exercise in the design of a simple 1 bit CPU.   With only logical single bit operations available the complexity is much reduced and it still has all it needs to have to be a Turing Complete computer. After all, a Turing Machine is a one bit computer.

It uses [Logisim-evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) digital circuit design and simulation package.

## File list

### 1bit_CPU.circ

XML file containing the circuit, generated by the Logisim package.

### assembler

Assembler for the assembly language for the processor. 
```
Usage
  assembler [source] [options]
    
    Assembles the source file into a Logisim "v3.0 hex words addressed" format
    to load into the program ROM of the CPU.

  [source]  Name of the file containing the code to be assembled.
            If omitted "program.asm" will be used.
            If the extension is omitted, ".asm" will be appended to the given base name

  Options:
    -h             Shows this message and exits.
    -o <filename>  Name of the output assembled code in Logisim-compatible format.
                   If omitted, the base name of the source file will be used.
                   If no extension is given ".rom" will be appended.
  
  Examples:

    ./assembler

      It will assemble the file "program.asm" and produce "program.rom"

    ./assembler test

      Assembles "test.asm" into "test.rom"

    ./assembler test.txt

      Assembles "test.txt" into "test.rom"

    ./assembler -o something

      Assembles "program.asm" into "something.rom"

```
